# TetrisUI
In this game, shapes fall from the top, and the player’s goal is to move and rotate them to fit into rows. Once a row is completely filled, it disappears, and the player earns points.

### How it works:
+ Starting the Game: When the game launches, a panel appears with two buttons: "Start" and "Exit." The player can click "Start" to begin the game or "Exit" to close it.
+ Creating a Shape: The game randomly creates a shape (like a square or line) and assigns it a random color.
+ Moving the Shape: The player can move the shape left, right, or down, and can also instantly drop it to the bottom.
+ Rotating the Shape: The player can rotate the shape. If the shape goes off the screen after rotating, the game automatically adjusts its position to keep it visible.
+ Freezing the Shape: Once the shape touches the bottom or another shape, it locks in place and can no longer move.
+ Clearing Rows: When a row is completely filled with blocks, it disappears, and the rows above drop down to fill the space.
+ Speed Increase: The game keeps track of the total number of cleared rows. Every time the player clears 3 rows, the speed at which the shapes fall increases.
+ End of the Game: If the shapes stack up to the top of the game board and there’s no more space for new shapes, the game ends. When this happens, a panel appears on the screen with a "Game Over" message, letting the player know that they’ve lost. The player is then given the option to start a new game and try again by clicking the "Restart" button.
